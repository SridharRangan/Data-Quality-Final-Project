# Data-Quality-Final-Project

The goal of this semester project was to use libraries in Python to analyze a dataset.  The project used a FIFA datset provided on Kaggle.  We applied the CRISP-DM Methodology for data cleaning and then used Pandas, Numpy, SciPy and Seaborn to identify trends and insights.  The project concluded with a presentation to peers which included a demonstration of code and an explanation of the visuals developed.
